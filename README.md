# Boost Astronomy Competency Test

A simple vector library that supports boost units.

## Introduction
The purpose if this library is that it provides vector math functions that can be only computed if the units and dimension of the two
vectors are same. It reduces the chance of errors if you are dealing with many vectors with different units.

All the internal calculations are done on raw data as vector math only deals with magnitude and direction.
